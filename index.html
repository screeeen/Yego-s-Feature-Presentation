        <h2>Feature proposal for ecological visibility at the Yego service.</h2>
        <img style="width:100%" src="./overview.png" alt="">

        <h3>Intro to the problem of the urban air pollution</h3>
        <p>Air pollution is nowadays a big concern for goverments and society. It also brings big economical uncertainties. Yego users would be concerned about this fact. They are looking for sustainable services and products. With the Yego bikes, pollution
            can be reduced while enhancing sales. With an iteration over the existing design I would like to help increasing awareness about pollution and also understand how much retention rate can be improved on the Yego’s userbase.
        </p>

        <h3>Description of the feature</h3>
        <p>
            Frictionless, as an additional service, this feature calculates the carbon footprint generated every Yego ride and displays it to the user. Then it will be compared to the rest of conventional gas transport. Users can learn about how their impact on the
            environment is but also they can see how riding Yego is a good choice to help reducing emissions.
        </p>

            <img src="./ride_results.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <ul>
            The feature offers:
            <li>Real time air pollution indicator</li>
            <li> Pollution counter per use</li>
            <li>Awareness of the air pollution concern</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How this feature can help service conversion</h3>
        <p> The system would reward those users who are loyal to the service by implementing a small leveling game that rewards free consumables for saved carbon grams (comparing them to other vehicles emissions and using this as currency). These currency
            points are accumulated and transformed into prizes after the user reached a certain amount of points based on a formula that meets business strategy. The idea behind is to keep the user loyal, by aiming to complete the proposed levels.
            <h3>How this feature can foster branding</h3>
            The users can track their metrics. They will associate these learnings to the Yego brand. With this way of teaching users Yego becomes a brand related to sustainability.
            <ul>
                <li>Memorable learnings about personalised pollution impact</li>
                <li> By comparison with other services, yego would stand out as a cleaner option</li>
                <li> Organic marketing: sharing information about the saved emissions value</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How this feature can leverage city pollution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Boosting retention on users choosing Yego for their commute</li>
                <li>Raising community awareness</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How the benefits of this campaign can be communicated to users</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Show context: Users will know anytime what’s the current air pollution index</li>
                <li>Display metrics of your ride comparsion and learning about how to save emissions</li>
                <li>Link their impact on their context</li>
            </ul>
